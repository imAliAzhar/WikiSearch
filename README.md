# Search-Engine-Project
Hello peeps
We are going to work on our Project on GitHub.
Search-Engine-Project is a private repository. Only those can view/edit who have been granted access.

---

Download GitHub from here
https://desktop.github.com/

If you don't know GitHub yet, look at these tutorials
=> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk
(look for other tutorials if this doesn't make sense or ask me if you have any problem)

Feel free to push(add) any dummy files to practice on this repository. Or create your own and practice there.
There is a tutorial in the installed GitHub application too.

Our first milestone is to create a Crawler. I will share resources over here. If you find some too, add them here.
